Here are some terminal commands I actually use day-to-day. As a Windows user, my default terminal is PowerShell (and often inside VS Codium).

## `TAB` and `SHIFT + TAB`

You can often combine a command with `TAB` of `SHIFT + TAB` search for files or directories. For example, if your current directly is in this repo, you can type

```
git add s
```

and then hit `TAB` to get PowerShell to "autocomplete" the command to

```
git add .\SonardQube\
```

You could also type `cd ` (with a space) and then hit `SHIFT + TAB` to look through the directories in reverse-alphabetical order.
